# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions – Ezpectus

This repo contains my personal LeetCode solutions.  
My LeetCode profile: [Ezpectus](https://leetcode.com/u/ezpectus/)

## 🔥 Purpose

I’m sharing my solutions here to contribute to the community and track my growth.  
Sometimes I’ll drop new problems with full explanations, sometimes just raw code — depends on the vibe.

## 🛠️ Language

Most solutions are written in **C#**, sometimes in **C++**.  
If needed, I can write the same problem in both languages.

## 📁 Structure

- Solutions are grouped by difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Each file will usually contain:
  - ✅ Clean code
  - 🧠 Comments on logic
  - 📌 Approach or pattern used
  - 🔗 LeetCode link

## 📌 Notes

This repo grows as I grow.  
No copy-paste, no bullshit — just my real path through the grind.

Stay tuned, more coming soon.
