This repo contains my personal LeetCode solutions.  
My LeetCode profile: [Ezpectus](https://leetcode.com/u/ezpectus/)

## 🔥 Purpose

I’m sharing my solutions here to contribute to the community and track my growth.  
Sometimes I’ll drop new problems with full explanations, sometimes just raw code — depends on the vibe.

## ⭐ Support
This repo is a personal archive of architectural fichki and algorithmic modules.
If you found it useful — consider starring it. It helps me track impact and prioritize future content.

Most solutions are written in **C#**, sometimes in **C++**.  
If needed, I can write the same problem in both languages.

## 📁 Structure

- Solutions are grouped by difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Each file will usually contain:
