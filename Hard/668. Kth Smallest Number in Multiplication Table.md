# 668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table

---

## Problem Restatement
We are given a multiplication table of size `m x n` where `mat[i][j] = i * j` (1-indexed).  
We need to return the `k`-th smallest element in this table.

---

## Key Insight
The multiplication table is sorted row-wise and column-wise.  
We can use **binary search on the answer**:

1. **Search space:**  
   - Minimum value = 1  
   - Maximum value = m * n  

2. **Counting function:**  
   - For a candidate value `x`, count how many numbers in the table are ≤ `x`.  
   - For each row `i`, the largest value is `i * n`.  
   - Count contribution from row `i`: `min(n, x / i)`.  

3. **Binary search:**  
   - If count ≥ k → move left (possible answer).  
   - Else → move right.

## Code (C#)
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        int left = 1, right = m * n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (CountLessEqual(mid, m, n) >= k) right = mid;
             else  left = mid + 1;
            
        }
        return left;
    }

    private int CountLessEqual(int x, int m, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            count += Math.Min(n, x / i);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```



## Complexity
- **Time:** O(m log(mn))  
  - Binary search runs in O(log(mn)).  
  - Each step requires counting in O(m).  
- **Space:** O(1), only a few variables are used.

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `m = 3, n = 3, k = 5`  
- Search space: [1, 9]  
- mid = 5 → count = 6 ≥ 5 → move left  
- mid = 3 → count = 5 ≥ 5 → move left  
- **Answer = 3 ✅**

**Input:** `m = 2, n = 3, k = 6`  
- Search space: [1, 6]  
- mid = 3 → count = 4 < 6 → move right  
- mid = 5 → count = 5 < 6 → move right  
- mid = 6 → count = 6 ≥ 6 → move left  
- **Answer = 6 ✅**

---

## Conclusion
The solution uses **binary search on values combined with a counting function**.  
- Efficient even for large tables (`m, n ≤ 30,000`).  
- Guarantees correctness by narrowing down the search space until the exact k-th smallest number is found.
