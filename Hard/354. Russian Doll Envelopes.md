# üì¶ Russian Doll Envelopes ‚Äî Full Breakdown & C++ Solution

## üìò Problem Summary

You're given a list of envelopes, each defined by `[width, height]`.  
An envelope can be nested inside another **only if both width and height are strictly smaller**.

Your task is to find the **maximum number of envelopes** that can be nested inside each other ‚Äî like Russian dolls.

---

## üß† Architectural Interpretation

The problem gives a list of envelopes `[width, height]` and asks for the longest chain of envelopes where each one fits strictly inside the next.  
This is not a pairing or validation task ‚Äî it's a **chain-building problem under strict 2D constraints**.

---

## üß© Key Architectural Signals

- **Strict inequality on both dimensions**  
  ‚Üí No duplicates allowed. Equal widths must be blocked from nesting. Signals the need for a clean growth model.

- **Maximize nesting count**  
  ‚Üí We're not checking feasibility ‚Äî we're building the longest valid sequence. This is a classic LIS signal.

- **Input size up to 10‚Åµ**  
  ‚Üí Brute-force, recursion, and 2D DP are architecturally invalid. We need log-time operations and dimensional reduction.

- **Two-dimensional comparison**  
  ‚Üí We must collapse the problem into 1D to apply scalable algorithms. This is a textbook case for sorting + LIS.

üìå Together, these signals define the architecture:  
> Sort envelopes to stabilize one dimension, then apply LIS on the other to build the longest valid chain.

## üíª C++ Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEnvelopes(vector<vector<int>>& envelopes) {
        // Sort by width ‚Üë, and by height ‚Üì if widths are equal
        sort(envelopes.begin(), envelopes.end(), [](auto &a, auto &b) {
            if (a[0] == b[0]) return a[1] > b[1];
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });

        // Apply LIS on height
        vector<int> dp;
        for (auto& env : envelopes) {
            int h = env[1];
            auto it = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), h);
            if (it == dp.end()) dp.push_back(h);
            else *it = h;
        }

        return dp.size();
    }
};

```

## üß± Architectural Signals

| Signal                    | Role in Solution                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sort by width ‚Üë, height ‚Üì** | Filters out invalid nesting cases ‚Äî ensures strict growth in both dimensions       |
| **LIS on height**         | Builds the longest valid nesting chain                                          |
| **lower_bound**           | Efficiently finds position to extend or replace in the chain                    |
| **dp array**              | Stores current best chain ‚Äî minimal values for each length                      |

Each signal contributes to:

- **Dimensional reduction** ‚Äî collapsing 2D nesting into 1D sequence  
- **Chain stability** ‚Äî maintaining valid growth without false positives  
- **Search efficiency** ‚Äî avoiding brute-force and redundant checks

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity Type   | Expression     | Explanation                                      |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n log n)     | Sorting + LIS via binary search                  |
| **Space Complexity**| O(n)           | dp array to store LIS                            |

Efficient enough to handle up to **100,000 envelopes** without performance degradation.

## üîÑ Why This Architecture Works

- **Sorting stabilizes the first dimension**  
  Ensures envelopes are processed in valid order ‚Äî width always increases

- **Descending height blocks false nesting**  
  Prevents envelopes with equal width from entering the LIS chain ‚Äî avoids duplicates

- **LIS builds the optimal chain**  
  Each height is either added or replaces an existing value ‚Äî no backtracking needed

- **No recursion, no brute-force**  
  The solution is clean, fast, and scalable ‚Äî avoids O(n¬≤) pitfalls

- **Dimensional reduction**  
  Transforms a 2D nesting problem into a 1D optimization problem ‚Äî classic architectural move

---

## üß† Summary

This problem is a classic example of **dimensional reduction + subsequence optimization**:

- We reduce 2D nesting to 1D LIS  
- We use sorting to stabilize input and filter invalid cases  
- We apply LIS to build the longest valid nesting chain  
- We avoid brute-force and recursion entirely

**Key takeaway:**  
This isn‚Äôt just a solution ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **structural transformation**.  
We turn a 2D chaos into a 1D order and solve it with architectural clarity.
