# Problem: Chalkboard XOR Game  
## Number: LeetCode 810  
**Difficulty**: Hard  
**Language**: C++

## Problem Overview

You are given an array `nums` representing numbers written on a chalkboard.  
Two players, Alice and Bob, take turns erasing exactly one number from the board. Alice goes first.

### Rules

- If erasing a number causes the XOR of all remaining numbers to become `0`, the player who made the move **loses**.
- If a player starts their turn and the XOR of all numbers is already `0`, they **win immediately**.

Return `true` if Alice wins the game assuming both players play optimally.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000`  
- `0 ≤ nums[i] < 2¹⁶`  
- All players play optimally

---

## Observations

- XOR is associative and commutative: the order of removal doesn't affect the final XOR.
- If the initial XOR of all elements is `0`, Alice wins immediately.
- If the initial XOR is non-zero:
  - If the number of elements is **even**, Alice can always force a win.
  - If the number of elements is **odd**, Alice will eventually be forced to make the last move and lose.

This is a known result from combinatorial game theory:  
In XOR-based games with optimal play, even-length arrays favor the first player, unless the XOR is already zero.

## Algorithm Summary

1. Compute the XOR of all elements.
2. If the XOR is `0`, Alice wins immediately.
3. If the array length is even, Alice can always win by mirroring Bob's strategy.
4. If the array length is odd and XOR is non-zero, Alice loses.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool xorGame(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            res ^= val;
        }

        bool xored = (res == 0);
        bool evenLength = (nums.size() % 2 == 0);

        return xored || evenLength;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**  
`O(n)` — single pass to compute XOR of all elements.

**Space Complexity**  
`O(1)` — no extra space used beyond a few variables.

---

## Why This Works

The XOR of all elements determines the initial game state.

- If the XOR is `0`, Alice wins immediately before making any move.
- If the XOR is non-zero:
  - With an **even** number of elements, Alice can always avoid losing by mirroring Bob’s strategy.
  - With an **odd** number of elements, Bob can force Alice into a losing move on the final turn.

This is a classic example of a **parity-based game strategy**, where the number of elements and the XOR value together determine the outcome under optimal play.
