# Intuition
The problem asks whether any element in the array appears a prime number of times. Since prime numbers are greater than 1 and only divisible by 1 and themselves, we can focus on counting the frequency of each element and checking if any of those frequencies are prime.

# Approach
Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each element in the array.

Iterate through the frequency values.

For each frequency, check if it is a prime number using a helper function.

If any frequency is prime, return true. Otherwise, return false.

# Complexity
Time complexity: $$O(n + m \sqrt{k})$$ Where:

𝑛 is the length of the input array

𝑚 is the number of unique elements

𝑘 is the maximum frequency value

Space complexity: $$O(m)$$ For storing the frequency dictionary

# Code
```csharp []
public class Solution {
    public bool CheckPrimeFrequency(int[] nums) {
        var freq = new Dictionary<int,int>();
          
     foreach (int num in nums) {
        if (!freq.ContainsKey(num)) freq[num] = 0;
        freq[num]++;
    }


           foreach(var kvp in freq){
            if(IsPrime(kvp.Value)){
                return true;
             }
           }
       return false;

    }

    private bool IsPrime(int n){
          if(n <= 1) return false;

          for(int i = 2; i * i <= n ;i++){
            if( n % i == 0){
                return false;
             }
          }
      return true;

    }
}
```
