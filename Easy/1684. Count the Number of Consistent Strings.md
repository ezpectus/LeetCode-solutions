## 🧩 Problem: Count the Number of Consistent Strings

A string is considered **consistent** if all of its characters are present in the `allowed` string.  
Return the number of consistent strings in the array `words`.

---

## ✅ Approach

You're spot on with the intuition:

> "Record the characters and check if each word only uses allowed ones."

Here’s how that breaks down architecturally:

### Steps:

1. **Build a set of allowed characters** for O(1) membership checks.
2. **Iterate over each word** in the `words` array.
3. For each word, **check every character**:
   - If all characters are in the allowed set → it's consistent.
4. **Increment the result counter** for each consistent word.



## 💡 Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int CountConsistentStrings(string allowed, string[] words) {
        var allowedset = new HashSet<char>(allowed);
        int res = 0;

        foreach (var word in words) {
            bool consist = true;

            foreach (char c in word) {
                if (!allowedset.Contains(c)) {
                    consist = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (consist) res++;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```


## 🧠 Pattern Used

- **Set Lookup for Membership Check**  
  Use a `HashSet` to store allowed characters for fast O(1) lookup.

- **Nested Loop with Early Exit**  
  Iterate through each word and break early if any character is disallowed.

- **Boolean Flag for Validation**  
  Track consistency using a flag that flips on invalid input.

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

- Word contains a single disallowed character → ❌ not counted  
- Empty `words` array → return `0`  
- `allowed` contains all 26 letters → all words are consistent

---

## 🔁 Reusable Insight

This pattern generalizes to any problem where you need to:

- Validate elements against a fixed set of allowed values  
- Use **set membership** for fast lookup  
- Apply **early exit** to optimize nested checks
