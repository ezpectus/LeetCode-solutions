## 🧩 Problem: Count Common Words With One Occurrence

Given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`, return the number of strings that appear **exactly once** in **each** array.

---

## ✅ Approach

We want to count how many strings appear **exactly once** in both arrays.  
This is a classic case for **dual frequency maps** and a conditional filter.

### Steps:

1. **Build frequency maps** for both arrays:
   - `freq1[word] = count in words1`
   - `freq2[word] = count in words2`

2. **Iterate over keys in freq1**, and for each word:
   - Check if `freq1[word] == 1` **and** `freq2[word] == 1`
   - If true, increment result

3. **Return total count**

## 💡 Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int CountWords(string[] words1, string[] words2) {
        var freq1 = new Dictionary<string, int>();
        var freq2 = new Dictionary<string, int>();

        foreach (var word in words1) {
            if (!freq1.ContainsKey(word)) freq1[word] = 0;
            freq1[word]++;
        }

        foreach (var word in words2) {
            if (!freq2.ContainsKey(word)) freq2[word] = 0;
            freq2[word]++;
        }

        int res = 0;
        foreach (var word in freq1.Keys) {
            if (freq1[word] == 1 && freq2.ContainsKey(word) && freq2[word] == 1) {
                res++;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Pattern Used

- **Dual Frequency Maps**: Track counts separately for each array  
- **Exact Match Filter**: Only include words with `count == 1` in both  
- **Key Intersection with Condition**: Only count if word exists in both maps and satisfies condition

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

- Words that appear more than once in either array → ❌ not counted  
- Words that appear in only one array → ❌ not counted  
- Empty arrays → `return 0`

---

## 🔁 Reusable Insight

This pattern generalizes to any problem where you need to:

- Compare frequency distributions across two datasets  
- Filter based on exact match conditions (`== k`)  
- Use dictionary intersection with constraints
