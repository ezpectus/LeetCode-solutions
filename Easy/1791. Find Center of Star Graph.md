# ðŸ§  Find Center of Star Graph â€” Signal-Based Logic

Problem Summary
```
Given a star graph represented by edges, 
find the center node â€” the one connected to all other nodes.
```
## ðŸ”§ Architectural Insight
In a valid star graph:

The center node appears in every edge

Therefore, it must be present in the first two edges

## ðŸ“¦ Signal:

The node that appears in both edges[0] and edges[1] is the center.

## âœ… Code Logic
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindCenter(int[][] edges) {
        int a = edges[0][0];
        int b = edges[0][1];
        int c = edges[1][0];
        int d = edges[1][1];

        if (a == c || a == d) return a;
        return b;
    }
}
```
## ðŸ§  Why It Works

Compare the two first edges: [a, b] and [c, d]

- If a appears again â†’ it's the center
- If not â†’ b must be the center
- No need to build a graph or count degrees â€” just pattern match

## âœ… Final Signal

- Center node = the one shared between the first two edges
- Time complexity: O(1)
- Clean, optimal, and signal-driven
