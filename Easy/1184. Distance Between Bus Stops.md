## 🚌 Pattern: Minimum Distance on a Circular Path

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Given a circular array `distance[]` where `distance[i]` represents the distance from stop `i` to `(i + 1) % n`, 
compute the **shortest distance** between two bus stops `start` and `destination`. 
The bus can travel in **both directions** (clockwise and counterclockwise).

---

### 🧠 Core Idea
- Normalize the direction: always treat `start ≤ destination` to simplify traversal.
- Compute:
  - `clockwise` distance: sum of distances from `start` to `destination - 1`
  - `total` distance: sum of all segments in the circle
  - `counterclockwise` distance: `total - clockwise`
- Return the **minimum** of the two.

---

### 🧱 Architectural Pattern

```text
1. Normalize: if start > destination → swap
2. Traverse once:
   - Accumulate total distance
   - Accumulate clockwise distance if i ∈ [start, destination)
3. Return min(clockwise, total - clockwise)
```

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int DistanceBetweenBusStops(int[] distance, int start, int destination) {
        if(start > destination){
            int temp = start;
            start = destination;
            destination = temp;
        }

        int dist = 0;
        int total = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < distance.Length;i++){
            total += distance[i];

            if(i >= start && i < destination){
                dist += distance[i];
            }
        }
     return Math.Min(dist, total - dist);

    }
}
```

Input: distance = [1, 2, 3, 4], start = 0, destination = 3

Clockwise: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6  
Total: 10  
Counterclockwise: 10 - 6 = 4  
Output: min(6, 4) = 4 ✅
