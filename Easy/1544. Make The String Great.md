# 🧠 Problem: 1544. Make The String Great

## 📜 Description

You're given a string `s` consisting of **only uppercase and lowercase English letters**. A string is considered **"good"** if it does **not** contain any adjacent characters `s[i]` and `s[i+1]` such that:
- One is a lowercase letter and the other is the **same letter** in uppercase (or vice versa).

To make the string good, you can **repeatedly remove** such adjacent pairs. The process continues until no such pairs remain.

Return the final "good" string.  
Note: An **empty string is also considered good**.

---

## 📌 Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` contains only English letters (a–z, A–Z)
- The final result is **guaranteed to be unique**

---

## 🧱 Approach

### 🔍 Key Observations

- The conflict condition is based on **ASCII difference**:  
  For any two characters `a` and `b`, if `Math.Abs(a - b) == 32`, then they are the same letter in different cases (e.g., `'a'` and `'A'`).
  
- Removing a bad pair may expose **new adjacent conflicts**, so we need a structure that supports **dynamic reduction**.

### 🧠 Architectural Pattern: Stack-Based Reduction

- Use a `Stack<char>` to simulate the reduction process.
- Traverse the string:
  - If the current character `c` conflicts with the top of the stack → `Pop()`
  - Else → `Push(c)`
- At the end, reverse the stack to reconstruct the final string.

### ⚙️ Why Stack?

- Efficient `Push`/`Pop` operations
- Avoids repeated string reconstruction (which would be O(n²))
- Final reversal gives correct character order

## 💻 Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string MakeGood(string s) {
        Stack<char> stack = new Stack<char>();

        foreach (char c in s) {
            if (stack.Count > 0 && Math.Abs(stack.Peek() - c) == 32) {
                stack.Pop(); // Conflict: remove the pair
            } else {
                stack.Push(c); // No conflict: keep the character
            }
        }

        var arr = stack.ToArray();     // Stack is LIFO → reversed order
        Array.Reverse(arr);            // Restore original order
        return new string(arr);        // Build final string once
    }
}
```


## 🧠 Conclusion

- This problem is a classic example of greedy reduction with a structural invariant.
- By recognizing the ASCII-based conflict rule and using a stack to manage dynamic deletions, we achieve an elegant O(n) solution.

🔁 Core Insight:
"Use a stack to simulate conflict resolution in strings where adjacent character rules apply. 
ASCII math enables fast detection, and stack reversal avoids costly string operations."

You can generalize this pattern to:

- Parentheses validation
- Duplicate removal
- Custom string simplification pipelines
