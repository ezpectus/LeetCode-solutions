## 🧠 Pattern: Bitwise Threshold Aggregation (`FindKOr`)

### 📌 Problem Summary

**Leetcode 2917 — Find the K-or of an Array**

You're given:
- An integer array `nums`
- An integer `k`

Define a custom operation called **K-or**:  
For each bit position `i` (0 to 31), set bit `i` in the result **if at least `k` numbers** in `nums` have bit `i` set to `1`.

Return the final integer result of the K-or operation.

---

### 📐 Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50` → small enough for brute-force bitwise scan
- `0 <= nums[i] < 2^31` → all numbers fit in 32-bit signed integer
- `1 <= k <= nums.length` → threshold is always valid

---

### 🧩 Core Idea

This is a **bitwise aggregation with quorum logic**.  
Instead of computing a standard OR across all numbers, we count how many numbers have `1` in each bit position.  
If the count for a bit ≥ `k`, we set that bit in the result.

This pattern generalizes to:
- Voting systems over binary flags
- Feature presence detection across multiple entities
- Bitmask consensus logic

### ✅ Code (C#)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindKOr(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] bitCount = new int[32];

        foreach (int num in nums) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
                if (((num >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                    bitCount[i]++;
                }
            }
        }

        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if (bitCount[i] >= k) {
                res |= (1 << i);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
## 🧠 Pattern Breakdown

This section dissects the core logic of the `BitwiseThresholdOr` pattern used in Leetcode 2917.  
Each step is intentional and contributes to a clean, scalable solution.

| Step                  | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bitCount[32]`        | Initialize a fixed-size array to count how many times each bit is set. |
| `num >> i & 1`        | Bitwise check: is bit `i` set in the current number?                    |
| `bitCount[i]++`       | Increment the count for bit `i` if it's set.                            |
| `bitCount[i] >= k`    | Apply quorum logic: if `k` or more numbers have bit `i` set, include it.|
| `res |= (1 << i)`     | Set bit `i` in the result using bitwise OR.                             |

This breakdown reflects a **bitwise voting system**, where each bit position is treated as a candidate, and each number casts a vote by setting that bit. If the number of votes reaches the threshold `k`, the bit is elected into the final result.

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough
```
**Input**: `nums = [7,12,9,8,9,15]`, `k = 4`  
**Binary Representation**:

7 = 0111
12 = 1100
9 = 1001
8 = 1000
9 = 1001
15 = 1111
```


**Bit Analysis**:

- **Bit 0**: Set in 7, 9, 9, 15 → count = 4 ✅  
- **Bit 3**: Set in 12, 9, 8, 9, 15 → count = 5 ✅  
- Other bits: Do not meet the threshold `k = 4`

**Result**:  
Only bits 0 and 3 qualify → binary `1001` → decimal `9`

This example illustrates how the algorithm filters bits based on quorum and constructs the final result using only those that pass the threshold.

## 🧱 Pattern Name

**BitwiseThresholdOr**

A reusable pattern for any scenario where bits are aggregated across entities and selected based on a minimum threshold.  
This is not a standard OR — it's a **consensus-driven OR**, making it ideal for systems that require quorum logic over binary states.

---

## 🧠 Complexity

| Metric     | Value         |
|------------|---------------|
| Time       | `O(n * 32)`   → Iterate over each number and each bit position |
| Space      | `O(32)`       → Fixed-size array for bit counts |

Efficient and predictable — no dynamic allocations, no nested structures, just clean bitwise logic.

---

## 🧰 Reusability

This module generalizes well to multiple domains:

- ✅ **Consensus-based bitmasking** — where multiple sources vote on binary flags  
- ✅ **Feature flag aggregation** — determine which features are active across systems  
- ✅ **Bit-level quorum voting** — useful in distributed systems or parallel computation  
- ✅ **Custom OR logic with thresholds** — when standard OR is too permissive

The pattern is compact, scalable, and easy to adapt to variations like weighted votes or dynamic thresholds.

---

## 🧠 Meta

This task is deceptively simple — but architecturally elegant.  
It reinforces a key engineering principle:

> **Bitwise operations are not low-level hacks — they are high-level tools for compact logic and scalable aggregation.**

By abstracting bit positions into vote counters, we transform a raw binary operation into a meaningful decision-making process.  
This is the kind of pattern that belongs in any serious engineer’s toolkit — not because it’s hard, but because it’s **clean, reusable, and powerful**.
