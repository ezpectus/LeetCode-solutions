#  Intuition
To maximize the number of ice cream bars we can buy, we should always purchase the cheapest available ones first. This is a classic greedy strategy: buy as much as possible starting from the lowest cost.

# Approach
Use counting sort to track how many ice cream bars exist at each price point.

Prices range from 1 to 10‚Åµ, so we use a frequency array of size 100001.

Iterate through prices from lowest to highest.

At each price:

Determine how many bars we can afford (coins / price)

Buy the minimum of that and the available quantity (freq[price])

Update coins and increment the total count

Stop when we can no longer afford even the cheapest remaining bar.

# Complexity
Time complexity: $$O(n + k)$$ where n is the number of ice cream bars and k = 10^5 is the price range.

Space complexity: $$O(k)$$ for the frequency array.

# Code
```csharp []
//Counting sort + greedy array

public class Solution {
    public int MaxIceCream(int[] costs, int coins) {
         int[] freq = new int[100001];

        foreach(int cost in costs){
            freq[cost]++;
        }
    
    int count =0;
    for(int price = 1; price <= 100000;price++){
         if(freq[price] == 0) continue;

         int maxbuy = Math.Min(freq[price], coins /price);
            count += maxbuy;
            coins -= maxbuy * price;

          
          if(coins < price) break;
    }

  return count;
    
    }
}
```
