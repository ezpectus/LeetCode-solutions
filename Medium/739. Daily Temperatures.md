# 🌡️ 739. Daily Temperatures

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `temperatures` representing the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `i-th` day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, set `answer[i] = 0`.

## 🔍 Example

```txt
Input:  temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]  
Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

## 💡 Intuition
- This is a classic monotonic stack problem. 
- We want to track indices of temperatures in a stack such that the stack always contains decreasing temperatures.
- When we find a warmer temperature, we pop from the stack and compute the difference in days.

## 🛠️ Approach

- Initialize a result array res of the same length as temperatures, filled with zeros.
- Use a stack to store indices of unresolved temperatures.

Traverse the array:

- While the current temperature is warmer than the temperature at the top of the stack:
- Pop the index from the stack
- Compute the difference between current index and popped index
- Store it in res

Push the current index onto the stack

## 📦 Code (C#)
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[] DailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
        int n = temperatures.Length;
        var stack = new Stack<int>();
        int[] res = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (stack.Count > 0 && temperatures[stack.Peek()] < temperatures[i]) {
                int idx = stack.Pop();
                res[idx] = i - idx;
            }
            stack.Push(i);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- Time Complexity	O(n) — each index is pushed and popped once
- Space Complexity	O(n) — for the stack and result array
