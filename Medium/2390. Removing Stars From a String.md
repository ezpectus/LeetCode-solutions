# 🧠 Problem Guide: Removing Stars From a String

**LeetCode ID:** 2390  
**Pattern:** Stack Simulation  
**Tags:** `Stack`, `String`, `Simulation`, `Greedy Removal`  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Architectural Role:** Input Sanitization / Symbolic Reduction

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
You're given a string `s` containing lowercase letters and asterisks `*`.  
Each `*` acts as a backspace, removing the closest non-star character to its left.  
Return the final string after all stars have been processed.

**Example:**  
- Input: `"leet**cod*e"`  
- Output: `"lecoe"`

---

## 💡 Intuition  
This is a classic case of **symbolic reduction**, where each `*` undoes a previous character.  
The removal is always **local and leftward**, which naturally maps to a **stack**:

- Push characters  
- Pop when a `*` appears  

This is a direct simulation of the string's transformation — no need for post-processing or index tracking.

---

## 🛠️ Approach  
We simulate the string transformation using a `Stack<char>`:

1. **Traverse the string**:
   - If the character is a letter → `Push` to stack  
   - If it's a `*` → `Pop` the top of the stack (if not empty)  
2. **Reconstruct the result**:
   - Reverse the stack and join characters to form the final string

This approach guarantees correctness because it respects the order and locality of removals.

## 📦 Code Implementation
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string RemoveStars(string s) {
        var stack = new Stack<char>();

        foreach (char c in s) {
            if (c == '*') {
                if (stack.Count > 0)
                    stack.Pop();
            } else {
                stack.Push(c);
            }
        }

        var result = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (char c in stack.Reverse()) {
            result.Append(c);
        }

        return result.ToString();
    }
}
```
## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- Metric	Complexity
- Time Complexity	$$O(n)$$
- Space Complexity	$$O(n)$$
- We iterate through the string once
- Stack may hold up to all characters (if no stars)

## 🧩 Pattern Insight: Stack Simulation
This problem belongs to a family of symbolic reduction tasks, where operations modify or undo previous input. Other examples include:

- Valid Parentheses
- Backspace String Compare
- Decode String
- HTML tag sanitization
- The core idea is to simulate the transformation using a stack or deque, preserving order and reversibility.

## 🧱 Engineering Context
This pattern is useful in:

- Text editors (undo operations)
- Compiler design (token reduction)
- Input sanitization (removing invalid or redundant symbols)
- Custom parsers (e.g., markdown, HTML)

## 🧠 Meta Note
This solution is not just about solving the problem — it's about recognizing a reusable architectural pattern:

- “When input contains reversible operations, simulate with a stack to preserve locality and order.”
