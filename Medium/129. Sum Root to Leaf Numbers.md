# Pattern Name  
Recursive Tree Traversal with Path Accumulation

---

## Problem Summary

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9.  
Each root-to-leaf path represents a number formed by concatenating the digits.  
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

---

## Core Idea

This is a **recursive DFS** problem where we accumulate the number along each path.  
At each node, we multiply the current number by 10 and add the node's value.  
When we reach a leaf, we return the full number.  
The final result is the sum of all such leaf numbers.

## C# Implementation

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int SumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        return DFS(root, 0);
    }

    private int DFS(TreeNode node, int num) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int current = num * 10 + node.val;
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) return current;
        return DFS(node.left, current) + DFS(node.right, current);
    }
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value       | Explanation                                  |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Time Complexity  | O(n)        | Visit each node once                         |
| Space Complexity | O(h)        | Call stack depth = tree height               |

## Generalization to Other Problems

This pattern applies to problems where:

- You traverse a tree and accumulate state along the path  
- You need to extract values from root-to-leaf paths  
- You use recursive DFS with parameter passing

| Problem Type         | Description                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Path Sum             | Check if any root-to-leaf path sums to target       |
| Binary Tree Paths    | Collect all root-to-leaf paths as strings           |
| Sum of Left Leaves   | Accumulate values based on structural position      |

## Final Takeaway

This solution uses:

- Recursive DFS to traverse the tree  
- Path accumulation via digit concatenation  
- Leaf detection to finalize values  
- Clean recursion with minimal state

The result is a concise and efficient solution for any task involving  
**root-to-leaf path evaluation in binary trees**.
