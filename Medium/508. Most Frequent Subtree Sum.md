# 508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum

---

## Problem Summary
We are given the root of a binary tree.  
- The **subtree sum** of a node = sum of all node values in the subtree rooted at that node (including itself).  
- Task: return the **most frequent subtree sum(s)**.  
- If multiple sums have the same highest frequency, return all of them in any order.  

---

## Core Idea
- Use **postorder DFS traversal** to compute subtree sums.  
- Maintain a **hash map** to count frequencies of each sum.  
- Track the maximum frequency while traversing.  
- Collect all sums that match the maximum frequency.

## C++ Implementation
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<int,int> freq;
    int maxFreq = 0;

    int dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        int sum = node->val + dfs(node->left) + dfs(node->right);
        freq[sum]++;
        maxFreq = max(maxFreq, freq[sum]);
        return sum;
    }

    vector<int> findFrequentTreeSum(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root);
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto &p : freq) {
            if (p.second == maxFreq) res.push_back(p.first);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity
- **Time:** O(n) — each node is visited exactly once during DFS.  
- **Space:** O(n) — the hash map may store up to n distinct subtree sums.  

---

## Pitfalls
- Must use **postorder traversal** to compute correct subtree sums (children first, then node).  
- Handle **negative values** correctly (`Node.val` can be as low as −10^5).  
- **Edge case:** single node tree → return its value directly.  
- If multiple sums have the same frequency → return all of them.  

---

## Example Walkthrough
**Input:** `root = [5,2,-3]`

**Subtree sums:**  
- Node(2) → 2  
- Node(-3) → -3  
- Node(5) → 5 + 2 + (-3) = 4  

**Frequencies:** {2:1, -3:1, 4:1}  
**Max frequency:** 1 → all sums are valid.  

**Output:** `[2, -3, 4]`  

---

## Conclusion
The problem reduces to **computing subtree sums via DFS** and tracking their frequencies.  
- Runs in **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space.  
- Robust for trees up to 10^4 nodes.  
- Clean, efficient, and optimal solution for this problem.
