# 🔄 MinReorder — Reorient Roads to Reach City 0

## 📌 Problem
Given n cities and a list of directed roads, return the minimum number of edges to reverse so that every city can reach city 0.

## 🧠 Approach
Build an undirected graph with direction flags:

(to, true) → original direction (needs reversal)

(from, false) → reverse direction (already good)

Start DFS from node 0, skip parent to avoid cycles

Count edges with needsChange == true

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
AddBack(num >= curr) → ignore

Duplicate edges → handled by SortedSet

Disconnected graph → not possible (guaranteed connected)


```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinReorder(int n, int[][] connections) {
        List<List<(int, bool)>> graph = new List<List<(int, bool)>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph.Add(new List<(int, bool)>());

        foreach (var conn in connections) {
            int from = conn[0], to = conn[1];
            graph[from].Add((to, true));   // true = original direction (needs change if used)
            graph[to].Add((from, false)); // false = reverse direction (already good)
        }

        int changes = 0;
        DFS(0, -1, graph, ref changes);
        return changes;
    }

    private void DFS(int node, int parent, List<List<(int, bool)>> graph, ref int changes) {
        foreach (var (neighbor, needsChange) in graph[node]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            if (needsChange) changes++;
            DFS(neighbor, node, graph, ref changes);
        }
    }
}
```
