# Problem: Maximum Number of Distinct Elements After Operations
- Number: LeetCode 3397
- Difficulty: Medium Language: C++

## Problem Overview
You're given an array nums and an integer k. 
Each element can be modified once by adding any integer in the range [-k, k].
Your goal is to maximize the number of distinct elements after performing these operations.

## Constraints
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 0 <= k <= 10^9

## Approach Summary
We use a greedy strategy with pointer tracking to assign each element a unique value within its allowed range.

Phase 1: Sort
- Sort nums to process duplicates in order.

Phase 2: Greedy Assignment
- Maintain a pointer prev to track the last assigned value.
- For each num, compute the earliest possible unique value l = max(num - k, prev + 1).
- If l <= num + k, assign it and update prev.

Phase 3: Count
- Each successful assignment increases the result counter.

## C++ Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistinctElements(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int res = 0;
        int prev = -1e9;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int l = max(nums[i] - k, prev + 1);
            if (l <= nums[i] + k) {
                prev = l;
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
## Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(n log n) — sorting + linear pass
- Space: O(1) — only counters and pointers

## Why This Works
- Sorting ensures duplicates are handled sequentially
- prev + 1 guarantees uniqueness
- max(num - k, prev + 1) ensures the value is within allowed range
- Greedy assignment avoids collisions and maximizes distinct count
