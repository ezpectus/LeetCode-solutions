# ðŸ§  Clone Graph â€” Deep Copy via DFS
---
Problem Summary:

You're given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph. Each node has:

- val: a unique integer identifier
- neighbors: a list of adjacent nodes

Your task is to return a deep copy of the graph â€” meaning:

- All nodes and edges are duplicated
- No shared references with the original graph

## ðŸ”§ Architectural Insight
This is a classic graph traversal + memoization problem.

## âœ… Key Signals:

- Graph may contain cycles â†’ avoid infinite recursion
- Nodes are referenced via object pointers, not just values
- We must track already cloned nodes to prevent duplication

## ðŸ§± Strategy: DFS + HashMap
- We use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph recursively. 
- To avoid cloning the same node multiple times, we maintain a visited dictionary:

```csharp
Dictionary<Node, Node> visited;
--
This maps each original node to its cloned counterpart.
```

## âœ… Code Implementation
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public Node CloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;

        var visited = new Dictionary<Node, Node>();
        return DFS(node, visited);
    }

    private Node DFS(Node node, Dictionary<Node, Node> visited) {
        if (visited.ContainsKey(node)) return visited[node];

        Node clone = new Node(node.val);
        visited[node] = clone;

        foreach (var neigh in node.neighbors) {
            clone.neighbors.Add(DFS(neigh, visited));
        }

        return clone;
    }
}
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Base Case: If node == null, return null â€” empty graph.
- Memoization Check: If the node is already cloned (exists in visited), return the clone.
- Clone Creation: Create a new node with the same val, store it in visited.
- Recursive Cloning: For each neighbor, recursively clone and add to the clone's neighbor list.

## âœ… Final Signal

- Time Complexity: O(N) â€” each node visited once
- Space Complexity: O(N) â€” due to recursion stack and visited map
- Clean, cycle-safe, and object-reference-safe deep copy
