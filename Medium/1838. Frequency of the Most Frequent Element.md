## 🧠 Sliding Window with Cost — Architectural Pattern

Sliding window is a powerful technique for problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings. But in some cases, the window isn't fixed by size — it's **adaptive**, constrained by a **cost function**.

This variant is useful when:

- You can modify elements (e.g., increment, replace) within a budget `k`
- You want to maximize the number of elements satisfying a condition
- The cost to include an element depends on its value and the current window state

**Core idea:**
> Expand the window while the cost of maintaining its validity is ≤ `k`. Shrink it when the cost exceeds `k`.

## 🧩 Problem: Frequency of the Most Frequent Element (Leetcode 1838)

### 📌 Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can increment any element by 1. Return the **maximum frequency** of any element after performing at most `k` operations.

## 🧠 Architectural Pattern: Sliding Window with Cost of Equalization

### 🔧 Key Insight
Sort `nums` to make it easier to equalize smaller elements to larger ones.

Use a window `[left..right]` such that all elements in the window can be incremented to match `nums[right]` within budget `k`.

---

### 🧮 Cost Formula
```plaintext
 cost = (right - left + 1) × nums[right] - sum(nums[left..right])

 (right - left + 1) → size of the window

 nums[right] → target value to equalize to

 sum(...) → sum of elements in the window

 cost → total operations needed to equalize all elements to nums[right]

 If cost > k, move left forward to shrink the window and reduce cost.
```

## 🧱 Invariants

- The window is always valid: all elements can be equalized to nums[right] within k
- Window state is updated incrementally (sum, size)
- Frequency = window size when invariant holds



```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MaxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n =nums.Length;
        int left = 0;
        int res = 0;
        long total = 0;
    
        Array.Sort(nums);
        for(int right =0; right < n;right++){
          total += nums[right];

     while((long)(right-left+1) * nums[right]- total > k){
             total -= nums[left];
             left++;

          }
          res = Math.Max(res,right-left+1);

        }

  return res;

    }
}
```

## ⚠️ Constraints

- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ nums[i], k ≤ 10⁵

- Time: O(n log n) due to sorting + O(n) scan
- Space: O(1) extra if sum is tracked incrementally

## 🧠 Pattern Generalization
This technique applies to problems where:

- You want to maximize the number of equal elements
- You can modify elements with limited budget
- The cost of equalization is a function of value and window size

## 🧠 Denis Notes — Intuitive Breakdown of Sliding Window Cost Logic

Locking in the problem:  
We're given an array `nums` and an integer `k` — the number of times we can increment elements. The goal is to **maximize the frequency** of a single value.

---

### 🔄 Thought Process

- Create a `long total` to accumulate the sum of elements inside the window.
- Initialize `left` and `res` — the window's left pointer and the result.
- Sort the array to make it easier to equalize smaller values to larger ones.
- Start iterating with `right = 0` up to `n` — expanding the window.

---

### 💡 Inside the loop:

- Add `nums[right]` to `total`.
- Check the **cost formula**:
  ```plaintext
  cost = (right - left + 1) × nums[right] - total
   ```

### 🧮 Cost Breakdown

- `(right - left + 1)` → window size  
- `nums[right]` → target value to equalize to  
- `total` → sum of elements in the window  

If `cost > k`, the window is too expensive:

- Move `left` forward  
- Subtract `nums[left]` from `total`  
- Repeat until the window becomes valid again

---

### ✅ After That

- Check the window size: `right - left + 1`  
- This is the max frequency if the window is valid  
- Update `res` if the current window is larger

---

### 🧠 Summary

The idea is to **expand the window** as long as we can "afford" to equalize all elements.  
Once the cost exceeds `k`, we **shrink the window** to stay within budget.  
Everything runs on **incremental sum tracking** and **sorting**.
