## 🧩 Module: Diagonal Matrix Traversal (C#)

### 🔧 Purpose  
Traverse a matrix diagonally, alternating direction (upward/downward). Useful in problems where elements are grouped by the sum of their indices.

---

### 🧠 Invariant  
All elements with the same index sum `i + j = k` lie on the same diagonal.

---

### 🏗️ Architecture

#### 🔹 Diagonal Grouping  
- Create `m + n - 1` lists to represent diagonals  
- For each cell `(i, j)`, append `mat[i][j]` to `diagonals[i + j]`

#### 🔹 Direction Control  
- If `k % 2 == 0` → reverse the diagonal (upward traversal)  
- If `k % 2 == 1` → keep as-is (downward traversal)

#### 🔹 Result Assembly  
- Concatenate all diagonals into a single output list

```csharз
public class Solution {
    public int[] FindDiagonalOrder(int[][] mat){

    int m = mat.Length, n = mat[0].Length;
    List<List<int>> diagonals = new List<List<int>>(m + n - 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < m + n - 1; i++)
        diagonals.Add(new List<int>());

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            diagonals[i + j].Add(mat[i][j]);

    List<int> result = new List<int>();
    for (int k = 0; k < diagonals.Count; k++)
    {
        if (k % 2 == 0)
            diagonals[k].Reverse();
        result.AddRange(diagonals[k]);
    }

    return result.ToArray();

    } 
}
```

### ⚙️ Complexity

- **Time:** O(m × n) — each element is visited once  
- **Space:** O(m + n) — for storing diagonals (excluding output)

### 🧱 Variations for Reuse

#### 🔸 Anti-diagonal Traversal (`i - j = k`)  
Groups elements by the difference of their indices. Useful for problems that require scanning from top-right to bottom-left or vice versa. This pattern is often used in rotated matrix views or reverse zigzag traversals.

#### 🔸 3D Diagonal Traversal (`i + j + k = d`)  
Extends the diagonal grouping concept to 3D matrices or tensors. Elements with the same combined index sum lie on the same diagonal plane. Useful in volumetric data processing, layered cube traversal, or multi-dimensional DP.

#### 🔸 Graph-Level Grouping  
Apply similar index-based grouping logic to graph structures:

- **BFS Layers:** Group nodes by their distance from the source node. Each layer corresponds to a traversal depth.
- **Manhattan Distance:** Group grid cells by `abs(i - x) + abs(j - y)` to simulate radial expansion from a point.
- **Wavefront Traversal:** Use index-based grouping to simulate layered or time-based expansion across a grid or graph, often used in simulations or dynamic programming over space-time grids.
