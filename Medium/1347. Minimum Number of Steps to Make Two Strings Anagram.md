# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram — Architectural Frequency Count Difference  
*O(n) — Optimal Single Pass with 26-Letter Arrays*

---

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t` of **same length**.

In one step: replace **any** character in `t` with another.

Return **minimum steps** to make `t` anagram of `s`.

---

## Core Idea — Count Character Differences

**Key insight**:
- Anagram → same character frequencies
- Steps = number of characters in `t` that **don't match** `s` frequencies
- More precisely: **half** the total absolute difference in counts
  - Because each replacement fixes one excess and one deficit

**Steps**:
1. Count frequency of each char in `s` and `t`
2. Sum `abs(count_s[c] - count_t[c])` over all c
3. Answer = **sum / 2** (integer division)

**Why /2**:
- Each replacement reduces total difference by 2

---

##  Implementation (C#)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinSteps(string s, string t) {
        int[] count = new int[26];

        // Increment for s, decrement for t
        foreach (char c in s)  count[c - 'a']++;
        foreach (char c in t)  count[c - 'a']--;
    
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (count[i] > 0)  diff += count[i]; // excess in s = needed replacements 
        }

        return diff;
    }
}
```

## Complexity

| **Metric**            | **Value**     | **Notes**                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Time Complexity**   | **O(n)**      | Single pass over strings                       |
| **Space Complexity**  | **O(1)**      | Fixed 26-letter array                          |

**Optimal** — constant space.

## Why This Works — Example Walkthrough

**Input**: `s = "bab"`, `t = "aba"`

- count_s: a:1, b:2
- count_t: a:2, b:1
- abs diff: |1-2| + |2-1| = **2**
- steps = 2 / 2 = **1**

**Correct** — replace one 'a' in t with 'b'.

**Input**: `s = "leetcode"`, `t = "practice"`

- Many character mismatches → total absolute difference = **10**
- steps = 10 / 2 = **5**

**Correct**.

**Input**: `s = "anagram"`, `t = "mangaar"`

- Identical frequency counts → diff = **0**
- steps = **0**

**Correct**.

---

## Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- **Same strings** → 0 steps
- **All characters different** → n/2 steps
- **n=1** → 0 (same) or 1 (different)
- **Mixed cases** → lowercase only (per constraints)

All handled perfectly.

---

## Key Takeaway

This is a **beautifully simple** frequency problem:

- **Count character differences**
- **Total mismatch / 2** → minimum replacements needed
- **O(1) space** → fixed alphabet size
**Pure, clean, optimal** — perfect anagram transformation.
