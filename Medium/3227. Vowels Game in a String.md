# ðŸ§  Vowels Game â€” Signal-Based Explanation

## Problem Summary

- Alice and Bob play a game on a string s.
- Alice starts first.
- On her turn, she must remove any non-empty substring with an odd number of vowels.
- Bob removes substrings with an even number of vowels.
- The first player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both play optimally.

## Goal

- Return true if Alice wins, false otherwise.

## ðŸ”§ Core Insight

The game is not about simulating moves. Itâ€™s about checking whether Alice can make a valid move at all.

---
## âœ… Key Signal:
- If the string contains at least one vowel, then Alice can always find a substring with an odd number of vowels (even just one vowel is enough).

- If the string contains zero vowels, Alice has no valid move and loses immediately.

## ðŸ§± Code Breakdown
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool DoesAliceWin(string s) {
        var vowels = new HashSet<char>{'a','e','i','o','u'};
        int count = 0;

        foreach (char c in s) {
            if (vowels.Contains(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        if (count == 0) return false; // No vowels â†’ no valid move for Alice
        return true; // At least one vowel â†’ Alice can start
    }
}
```


## ðŸ§  Architectural Commentary
- HashSet<char> is used to store unique vowel characters for fast lookup.

 We iterate through the string s, and for each character:

- If itâ€™s a vowel â†’ increment count
- After the loop:
- If count == 0 â†’ Alice has no valid move â†’ return false
- Else â†’ Alice can start â†’ return true

This is a parsing-based signal check, not a simulation. Itâ€™s fast, clean, and leverages vowel presence as the only necessary condition.

## âœ… Final Signal
- No vowels â†’ Alice loses
- At least one vowel â†’ Alice wins
