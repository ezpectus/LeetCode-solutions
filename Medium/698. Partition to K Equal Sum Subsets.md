# 📘 Description
Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, determine if it's possible to partition the array into `k` non-empty subsets such that the **sum of elements in each subset is equal**.

---

### 📌 Constraints
- `1 <= nums.Length <= 16`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁴`
- `1 <= k <= nums.Length`
- Total sum must be divisible by `k` → otherwise impossible
- Goal: assign each number to one of `k` buckets such that all buckets sum to `target = total / k`

---

## 💡 Architectural Insight

This is a **backtracking simulation** with **bucket-based pruning**.

### 🧠 Core Idea

- Sort `nums` in descending order → greedy placement of large numbers first
- Use `sums[]` array of size `k` to track current sum in each bucket
- At each step, try placing `nums[idx]` into any bucket `i` where `sums[i] + nums[idx] <= target`
- If placement leads to a valid full assignment → return `true`
- Prune redundant branches:
  - If `sums[i] == 0` after backtracking → break early (symmetry)

---

## 🧾 Code Pattern

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool CanPartitionKSubsets(int[] nums, int k) {
        Array.Sort(nums, (a, b) => b - a); // Greedy: place large numbers first
        int sum = nums.Sum();
        if (sum % k != 0) return false;

        int[] sums = new int[k];
        return Check(nums, 0, sums, sum / k);
    }

    bool Check(int[] nums, int idx, int[] sums, int target) {
        if (idx == nums.Length) return true;

        for (int i = 0; i < sums.Length; i++) {
            if (sums[i] + nums[idx] <= target) {
                sums[i] += nums[idx];
                if (Check(nums, idx + 1, sums, target)) return true;
                sums[i] -= nums[idx];
            }
            if (sums[i] == 0) break; // Prune symmetric branches
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```


## 🧩 Problem: Can Partition K Subsets (Leetcode 698)

### 📘 Description
Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, determine if it's possible to partition the array into `k` non-empty subsets such that the **sum of elements in each subset is equal**.

---

### 📌 Constraints
- `1 <= nums.Length <= 16`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁴`
- `1 <= k <= nums.Length`
- The total sum of all elements must be divisible by `k` for a valid partition to exist.

---

## 💡 Architectural Insight

This is a **bucket-based backtracking simulation** with **symmetry pruning** and **greedy ordering**.

We simulate placing each number into one of `k` buckets, ensuring:
- No bucket exceeds the target sum (`total / k`)
- Each number is used exactly once
- The recursion terminates only when all numbers are placed

To improve efficiency:
- We sort `nums` in descending order to place larger numbers first (greedy heuristic)
- We prune symmetric branches by avoiding placement into multiple empty buckets

|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Array.Sort(nums, desc)`          | Greedy heuristic: placing large numbers first reduces branching and early failures     |
| `sum % k != 0`                    | Early termination: if total sum isn't divisible by `k`, partitioning is impossible     |
| `sums[i] + nums[idx] <= target`   | Valid placement check: ensures bucket `i` won't overflow                               |
| `sums[i] += nums[idx]`            | Simulate placing `nums[idx]` into bucket `i`                                           |
| `Check(idx + 1)`                  | Recurse to place the next number                                                       |
| `sums[i] -= nums[idx]`            | Backtrack: undo placement if it leads to failure                                       |
| `sums[i] == 0 → break`            | Symmetry pruning: avoids placing into multiple empty buckets (equivalent states)       |
| `idx == nums.Length`              | Base case: all numbers placed → valid partition found                                  |

## 🧱 Engineering Pattern: Bucket-Based Backtracking with Symmetry Pruning

### 🧠 Use Case
Partition a set of elements into `k` groups with equal sum, under strict constraints.

---

### 🔧 Core Steps
1. **Sort input descending** for greedy placement — large numbers first.
2. **Check divisibility**: if `sum % k != 0`, return `false` immediately.
3. **Initialize `sums[]`**: an array of size `k` to track current bucket totals.
4. **Recursive placement**:
   - Try placing `nums[idx]` into each bucket `i` where `sums[i] + nums[idx] <= target`.
   - Recurse to next index.
   - Backtrack if placement fails.
5. **Prune symmetric branches**:
   - If `sums[i] == 0` after backtracking, break early to avoid redundant paths.

---

### 🔁 Generalization

This pattern applies to a wide range of problems:
- **Subset partitioning**: divide elements into groups with equal properties.
- **Bin packing**: distribute weights/items into fixed-capacity containers.
- **Load balancing**: assign tasks/resources evenly across workers.

Can be extended to:
- Variable bucket capacities
- Grouping constraints (e.g. element compatibility)
- Memoization via `(idx, mask)` or `(idx, sums)` for optimization

---

## ✅ Conclusions

This task reinforces several key engineering principles:

- **Backtracking with constraint pruning**: simulate all valid placements, but cut off invalid paths early.
- **Greedy ordering**: sorting input to reduce branching and improve early failure detection.
- **Symmetry awareness**: avoid redundant recursive states by recognizing equivalent configurations.
- **State tracking via arrays**: `sums[]` acts as a dynamic representation of current partition state.
