# 1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals

##  Problem Summary
We are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`.  
We must remove exactly `k` elements from the array such that the number of **unique integers** remaining is minimized.

---

##  Core Idea
- Count the frequency of each integer in the array.  
- Sort these frequencies in ascending order.  
- Greedily remove elements starting from the smallest frequency:  
  - If `k` is large enough to remove all occurrences of a number, reduce `k` and decrease the unique count.  
  - Stop when `k` is exhausted.  
- Return the number of unique integers left.

---

##  Code (C#)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindLeastNumOfUniqueInts(int[] arr, int k) {
        // Step 1: Count frequencies
        var freq = new Dictionary<int,int>();
        foreach (int num in arr) {
            if (!freq.ContainsKey(num)) freq[num] = 0;
            freq[num]++;
        }

        // Step 2: Sort frequencies ascending
        var counts = freq.Values.OrderBy(x => x).ToList();

        // Step 3: Remove k elements greedily
        int uniq = counts.Count;
        foreach (int c in counts) {
            if (k >= c) {
                k -= c;
                uniq--; // fully removed this number
            } else {
                break; // cannot remove completely
            }
        }

        return uniq;
    }
}
```

##  Complexity
- **Time:** O(n + m log m), where `n` = length of array, `m` = number of unique integers.  
- **Space:** O(m) for frequency dictionary.  

---

##  Pitfalls
- Must remove exactly `k` elements, not fewer.  
- Always start removing from the smallest frequency to minimize unique count.  
- Handle edge cases: `k = 0`, `arr` length = 1.  

---

##  Sanity Checks
- Input: `arr = [5,5,4], k = 1` → Output: `1` (remove 4).  
- Input: `arr = [4,3,1,1,3,3,2], k = 3` → Output: `2` (remove 4, 2, and one 1).  
- Input: `arr = [1,2,3], k = 0` → Output: `3`.  

---

## Key takeaway
This problem is a **frequency + greedy removal** task.  
By always removing the least frequent numbers first, we minimize the number of unique integers left.
