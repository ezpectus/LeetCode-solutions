# 655. Print Binary Tree — Architectural Solution

## Problem Statement
Given a binary tree root, construct a 2D string matrix that represents the tree in a fixed layout:

- Rows `m = height + 1`
- Columns `n = 2^{height+1} - 1`
- Root at position `(0, (n-1)/2)`
- Left child of node at `(r,c)` → `(r+1, c - 2^{height-r-1})`
- Right child → `(r+1, c + 2^{height-r-1})`
- Empty cells = `""`

Return the matrix as `IList<IList<string>>`.

Constraints: height ≤ 10 → n ≤ 2047

## Core Idea
The positioning is **purely mathematical** — based on powers of 2.
No need for level-order traversal with width calculation or string centering.

Just:
- Compute height
- Build full-size matrix filled with `""`
- Recursively place nodes using exact offset `2^{h-r-1}`

## Implementation (C#) 

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public IList<IList<string>> PrintTree(TreeNode root) {
        int h = Height(root);
        int m = h + 1;
        int n = (1 << (h + 1)) - 1;

        var res = new string[m][];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            res[i] = new string[n];
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                res[i][j] = "";
        }

        Fill(root, 0, (n - 1) / 2, h, res);
        return res;
    }

    private int Height(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return -1;
        return 1 + Math.Max(Height(node.left), Height(node.right));
    }

    private void Fill(TreeNode node, int r, int c, int h, string[][] res) {
        if (node == null) return;

        res[r][c] = node.val.ToString();

        int offset = 1 << (h - r - 1);
        if (node.left != null)
            Fill(node.left, r + 1, c - offset, h, res);

        if (node.right != null)
            Fill(node.right, r + 1, c + offset, h, res);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: **O(2^(h+1))** (approximately O(4^h))  
  We explicitly fill the entire output matrix - this is required by the problem. With h ≤ 10 → maximum ~4K cells → completely negligible.

* Space Complexity: **O(2^(h+1))**  
  Dominated by the output matrix itself (required) + O(h) recursion stack.

## Pitfalls & Edge Cases

* Height of null node = -1 → single node tree → h=0 → exactly 1 row
* Column count must be `(1 << (h + 1)) - 1` → gives the exact width of a full binary tree
* Offset calculation `1 << (h - r - 1)` — bit shift is crucial for correctness and speed
* Only recurse when child exists — prevents unnecessary calls and wrong placements
* Skewed or unbalanced tree — still perfectly positioned thanks to fixed power-of-2 offsets

## Conclusion
Beautiful reduction to pure mathematics.
No queues, no dynamic width tracking, no string manipulation tricks.

Just:

* Height computation
* Full matrix allocation
* Recursive placement with power-of-2 offsets

- The formula 2^(height-r-1) does **all** the alignment work for you.
- Once you trust the math - the code writes itself in 25 lines.
- Classic example of how **mathematical insight beats simulation** every time.
