#  1839. Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order

---

##  Problem Summary
We are given:
- A string `word` consisting only of vowels `'a','e','i','o','u'`.

A substring is **beautiful** if:
1. It contains all 5 vowels at least once.
2. Vowels appear in alphabetical order: all `'a'` before `'e'`, all `'e'` before `'i'`, etc.

Goal:
- Return the length of the longest beautiful substring.
- If none exists, return `0`.

---

##  Core Idea
- Traverse the string with a **sliding window** approach.  
- Track:
  - Current length of substring.
  - Number of distinct vowels seen in order.  
- Reset when order breaks (e.g., `'i'` followed by `'e'`).  
- Update maximum length only when all 5 vowels are present.

##  C# Implementation
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int LongestBeautifulSubstring(string word) {
        int n = word.Length;
        int maxLen = 0, currLen = 0,distinct = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && word[i] < word[i - 1]) {
                // order broken -> reset
                currLen = 0;
                distinct = 0;
            }
            currLen++;

            if (i == 0 || word[i] != word[i - 1]) distinct++;
            if (distinct == 5) maxLen = Math.Max(maxLen, currLen);
            
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

##  Complexity
- **Time:** O(n)  
  Single pass through the string to track order and distinct vowels.  
- **Space:** O(1)  
  Only counters (`currLen`, `distinct`, `maxLen`) are used.  

---

##  Pitfalls
- **Order reset:** Must reset counters when vowel order breaks (`word[i] < word[i-1]`).  
- **Distinct counting:** Increment distinct only when vowel changes, not for repeats.  
- **All vowels check:** Update result only when all 5 vowels are present.  
- **Edge case:** Single character string → return 0.  

---

##  Example Walkthrough
**Input:**  
`word = "aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu"`

**Traverse:**  
- `"aaaaeiiiiouuu"` is valid, length = 13.  
- Distinct vowels = 5.  
- Answer = 13.  

**Output:**  
`13`

---

##  Conclusion
- Problem reduces to scanning with sliding window and tracking vowel order.  
- Reset when order breaks, count distinct vowels, update max length when all 5 appear.  
- Efficient O(n) solution suitable for strings up to 5×10^5.
