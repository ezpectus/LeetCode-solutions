#  LeetCode 1764 — Form Array by Concatenating Subarrays of Another Array  
**Category:** Greedy / Pattern Matching  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Language:** C#  
**Pattern:** Sequential Subarray Matching with Disjoint Constraint

---

##  Problem Summary

You're given a list of `groups`, each a subarray pattern, and a target array `nums`.  
You must check whether it's possible to find **n disjoint subarrays** in `nums` such that:

- Each `groups[i]` matches exactly one subarray in `nums`
- The matched subarrays appear in the same order as in `groups`
- The matched subarrays are **disjoint** (no overlapping indices)

Return `true` if such a sequence of matches exists, otherwise `false`.

---

##  Architectural Insight

This is a **greedy sequential match** problem.  
We scan `nums` from left to right, trying to match each `groups[i]` in order.  
Once a group is matched, we **advance the pointer** in `nums` past the matched subarray to ensure disjointness.

Key idea:  
> **For each group, find its first occurrence in `nums` starting from the current index. If found, move forward. If not — return false.**

##  C# Implementation

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool CanChoose(int[][] groups, int[] nums) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        while (i < groups.Length && j < nums.Length) {
            if (IsMatch(groups[i], nums, j)) {
                j += groups[i].Length;
                i++;
            } else  j++;
        }

        return i == groups.Length;
    }

    private bool IsMatch(int[] group, int[] nums, int start) {
        if (start + group.Length > nums.Length) return false;

        for (int k = 0; k < group.Length; k++) {
            if (nums[start + k] != group[k]) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

##  Architectural Breakdown

| Component               | Role                                                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `i`                    | Index over `groups`                                         |
| `j`                    | Current scan position in `nums`                             |
| `IsMatch`              | Checks if `groups[i]` matches `nums` starting at index `j` |
| `j += group.Length`    | Ensures disjointness by skipping matched subarray          |

##  Why My Approach Is Superior

| Aspect               | My Approach                          | Alternative Approach                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Matching Strategy    | Greedy, left-to-right                | Backtracking or nested loops             |
| Disjointness         | Enforced via pointer advancement     | Risk of overlap if not careful           |
| Code Clarity         | Modular with helper method           | Monolithic or entangled logic            |
| Performance          | Linear scan with early exits         | Potential quadratic overhead             |
| Conceptual Ownership | Derived from sequential matching     | Often confused with full pattern search  |

##  Summary

This task isn’t about brute-force pattern search — it’s about sequential disjoint matching.  
Once I saw that, the rest was just system-building:

- Greedy scan  
- Match-and-advance  
- Disjoint enforcement via pointer shift

No backtracking, no overlap, no wasted cycles.  
Just clean architecture and minimal logic.

This module now lives in my repo as a reusable pattern:

> **Sequential Subarray Matching with Disjoint Constraint**

It’s not just a solution — it’s a signal of how I think.
