# FindCircleNum — Count Provinces via DFS

## 📌 Problem
Given an n x n adjacency matrix isConnected, where isConnected[i][j] == 1 means city i is directly connected to city j, return the number of provinces (i.e. connected components).

## 🧠 Approach
Treat the matrix as an undirected graph

Use DFS to explore each unvisited node

Each DFS call marks one full province

Count how many times DFS is initiated

## ⚠️ Edge Cases
Fully connected graph → 1 province

No connections → n provinces

Self-loops (isConnected[i][i] == 1) → ignored in traversal

```csharp

public class Solution {
    public int FindCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
        int n = isConnected.Length;
        bool[] visited = new bool[n];
        int provinces = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                DFS(isConnected, visited, i);
                provinces++;
            }
        }

        return provinces;
    }

    private void DFS(int[][] isConnected, bool[] visited, int city) {
        visited[city] = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < isConnected.Length; j++) {
            if (isConnected[city][j] == 1 && !visited[j]) {
                DFS(isConnected, visited, j);
            }
        }
    }
}
 ```
