# Maximal Square â€” Problem Breakdown & DP Solution
 ## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement
 
 You're given a 2D binary matrix filled with '0' and '1'. Your task is to find the largest square containing only '1's and return its area.

 ðŸ”¹ Example
```plaintext
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
```

Output: 4

 Explanation: The largest square of 1s has side length 2 â†’ area = 2 * 2 = 4

## ðŸ§  Core Idea
We use Dynamic Programming (DP) to track the maximum square size ending at each cell.

## ðŸ”¸ Key Insight:

- If matrix[i][j] == '1', then the largest square ending at (i, j) depends on:
- The square ending above (i-1, j)
- The square ending to the left (i, j-1)
- The square ending diagonally up-left (i-1, j-1)

## ðŸ”¸ DP Formula:
```plaintext
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
```
This ensures that the square can only grow if all three neighbors support it.

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MaximalSquare(char[][] matrix) {
        int rows = matrix.Length;
        int cols = matrix[0].Length;
        int[,] dp = new int[rows, cols];
        int maxSide = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                    if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                        dp[i, j] = 1;
                    } else {
                        dp[i, j] = Math.Min(Math.Min(dp[i - 1, j], dp[i, j - 1]), dp[i - 1, j - 1]) + 1;
                    }
                    maxSide = Math.Max(maxSide, dp[i, j]);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxSide * maxSide;
    }
}


```
