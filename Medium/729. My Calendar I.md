# 729. My Calendar I

---

## Problem
We need to implement a calendar that supports booking intervals.  
- Each booking is defined by `[startTime, endTime)`.  
- A booking is valid if it does **not overlap** with any existing booking.  
- Return `true` if the booking is successful, otherwise `false`.

---

## Key Idea
- Maintain a list of booked intervals.  
- For each new booking, check if it overlaps with any existing one.  
- Overlap condition:  
```
startTime < existingEnd && endTime > existingStart
```
- If overlap exists → return `false`.  
- Otherwise, add the new interval and return `true`.

---

## Code (C#)
```csharp
public class MyCalendar {
  private List<(int start, int end)> bookings;

  public MyCalendar() {
      bookings = new List<(int start, int end)>();
  }
  
  public bool Book(int startTime, int endTime) {
      // Check for overlap with existing bookings
      foreach (var (start, end) in bookings) {
          if (startTime < end && endTime > start) {
              return false; // overlap detected
          }
      }

      // No overlap → add booking
      bookings.Add((startTime, endTime));
      return true;
  }
}
```



## Complexity
- **Time:** O(n) per booking, since we check all existing intervals for overlap.  
- **Space:** O(n) for storing the list of bookings.

## Example Walkthrough
```csharp
MyCalendar obj = new MyCalendar();
obj.Book(10, 20); // true
obj.Book(15, 25); // false (overlaps with [10,20])
obj.Book(20, 30); // true (touching boundary is allowed)
```


## Example Walkthrough
- **First booking [10,20]** → no conflicts, returns **true**.  
- **Second booking [15,25]** → overlaps with `[10,20]`, returns **false**.  
- **Third booking [20,30]** → no overlap (touching boundary is allowed), returns **true**.  

---

## Conclusion
This solution uses a **simple list of intervals** and checks for overlaps linearly.  
- Efficient enough for **moderate input sizes**.  
- For larger constraints, a **balanced tree (`SortedSet`)** or **ordered map** can be used to achieve **O(log n)** booking checks.
