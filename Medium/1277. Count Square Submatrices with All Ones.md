# 🟩 Count Square Submatrices with All Ones

## 🧠 Problem Summary
You're given a binary matrix of 0s and 1s.  
Your task is to count how many **square submatrices** (of any size) contain **only 1s**.

---

## 🔍 Core Insight
We use **Dynamic Programming** to track the **maximum square size** ending at each cell.  
But instead of just tracking the largest square, we **sum all square sizes** to count every valid square.

## 🔧 DP Formula

```plaintext
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
```
 - If matrix[i][j] == 1, then it can be the bottom-right corner of a square.
- The size of the square depends on its top, left, and top-left neighbors.
- Each dp[i][j] contributes dp[i][j] squares to the total count.

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

## Concept	Description
dp[i][j]	Size of the largest square ending at (i, j)
Base Case	First row/column → dp[i][j] = 1 if cell is 1
Accumulation	Add dp[i][j] to total count
Final Output	Sum of all dp[i][j] values
🧩 Pattern Summary
This fits the pattern:

- "DP with local minimum propagation + cumulative count"

 Used when:

- Growth depends on uniform support from neighbors
- You need to count all valid configurations, not just the largest

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int CountSquares(int[][] matrix) {
        int rows = matrix.Length;
        int cols = matrix[0].Length;
        int[,] dp = new int[rows, cols];
        int total = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                        dp[i, j] = 1;
                    } else {
                        dp[i, j] = Math.Min(
                            Math.Min(dp[i - 1, j], dp[i, j - 1]),
                            dp[i - 1, j - 1]
                        ) + 1;
                    }
                    total += dp[i, j];
                }
            }
        }

        return total;
    }
}
```
