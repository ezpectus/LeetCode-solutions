# 🧩 **Problem**: Minimum Coins

---

### 📜 Description

You're given an array `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the cost to buy a coin on day `i`.  
If you buy a coin on day `i`, you receive **one free coin** on each of the next `i` days — but only one per day.

Your goal is to **collect coins for every day** with the **minimum total cost**.

---

### 🧠 Solution Architecture

#### 🔹 Core Strategy

This is a **recursive dynamic programming** problem with memoization.  
Each decision branches into multiple futures:

- You **must buy** the coin on day `i` (cost = `prices[i]`)
- Then you can **skip** up to `i` days ahead, since each of those days can be covered by the free coins
- You recursively jump to the next day that isn’t covered by the free coins

Key insight:  
Buying on day `i` covers days `i+1` to `i+i+1` for free.  
So the next paid day must be beyond that range.

### 🔁 Recursive Transition

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinimumCoins(int[] prices) {
        return dfs(prices, 0, new());
    }

    public int dfs(int[] prices, int curr, Dictionary<int, int> dp) {
        if (curr == prices.Length) return 0;
        if (dp.ContainsKey(curr)) return dp[curr];

        int cost = prices[curr];
        int min = int.MaxValue;
        int free = Math.Min(prices.Length - 1, curr + curr + 1);

        for (int i = curr + 1; i <= free; i++) {
            int buy = dfs(prices, i, dp);
            int take = dfs(prices, i + 1, dp);
            min = Math.Min(min, Math.Min(buy, take));
        }

        return dp[curr] = cost + (min == int.MaxValue ? 0 : min);
    }
}
```

## 🧱 Architectural Signals & Pattern Analysis — Minimum Coins

### 🔍 Architectural Signals

| Signal | Insight |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ **Memoization** | Uses `Dictionary<int, int>` to cache results and avoid recomputation — essential for exponential branching |
| ✅ **Recursive branching** | Explores all valid futures from current index, modeling decision space dynamically |
| ⚠️ **Implicit free coin logic** | Free coins are modeled via range `[i+1, i+i+1]`, but not explicitly tracked — this can obscure intent and complicate debugging |
| ⚠️ **Redundant recursion** | Calls both `dfs(i)` and `dfs(i+1)` — introduces unnecessary overlap and can be pruned with tighter range logic |
| ⚠️ **Naming** | Variables like `dfs`, `curr`, `take` are generic — renaming to `day`, `nextPaidDay`, `skipCost` would clarify intent |
| ⚠️ **No bottom-up version** | Recursive top-down is elegant but slower — iterative DP could reduce call stack depth and improve performance |

### 🧰 Pattern Summary

This problem exemplifies a powerful recursive DP pattern:

#### ✅ Ideal For:

- Problems with **limited free actions** after a paid decision  
- Scenarios requiring **cost minimization** while leveraging future benefits  
- Recursive modeling with **branching and memoization**

#### 🔗 Core Components:

- 🧮 **Memoization** for efficient reuse of subproblem results  
- 🔁 **Recursive branching** with dynamic range exploration  
- 📊 **Cost optimization** via full interval coverage and prefix pruning

### 🧪 Test Case Example

```csharp
prices = [1, 2, 3, 4]
// Buy at day 0 → cost = 1
// Covers days 1 and 2 for free
// Next paid day = 3 → cost = 4
// Total cost = 1 + 4 = 5
```

## 🧠 Strategic Takeaways — Minimum Coins Pattern

---

This pattern sharpens your ability to model **nonlinear transitions**, where a single action influences multiple future states. It’s not just about recursion — it’s about understanding how decisions ripple across time.

### 🔍 Key Learnings

- 🧠 **Nonlinear transitions**  
  Buying on day `i` affects a range of future days — this builds reflexes for problems where actions have **multi-day consequences**, common in scheduling, energy planning, and resource allocation.

- 📐 **Range-based coverage intuition**  
  You learn to reason about **intervals** rather than discrete steps. This is foundational for greedy-DP hybrids and coverage problems (e.g., ticketing, bandwidth, caching).

- 🧮 **State clarity**  
  Forces you to define what `dp[i]` actually means. Is it the minimum cost from day `i` onward? What transitions preserve correctness? This strengthens your architectural discipline.

## 🔄 Next Steps

These are the tactical improvements and generalizations to extract maximum value from the pattern:

- 🔄 **Refactor into bottom-up DP**  
  Replace recursion with iterative `dp[i]` array. This improves performance and avoids stack overflow on large inputs.

- 🧱 **Generalize the pattern**  
  Formalize it as:  
  **Buy → Cover Range → Skip to Next Paid Day**  
  This abstraction is reusable across:
  - Coin collection problems
  - Ticketing systems (e.g., LeetCode 983)
  - Energy cost minimization
  - Subscription models with free coverage

- 🧪 **Add edge-case unit tests**  
  Validate robustness with:
  - `[1]` → single day, minimal input
  - `[100, 1, 1, 1]` → expensive start, cheap tail
  - `[1, 100, 1, 100]` → alternating cost spikes

## 🧠 What This Pattern Builds

This isn’t just a solution — it’s a mental model.

- 🔬 **Architectural clarity**  
  You’re forced to define transitions, coverage windows, and state meaning with precision. This is critical for scalable systems thinking.

- 🧠 **Branching intuition**  
  You develop the ability to reason about **future states**, prune invalid paths, and optimize across multiple decision branches.

- 🧰 **Reusable templates**  
  This pattern lays the groundwork for:
  - `Minimum Cost for Tickets` (LC 983)
  - `Count Vowel Strings` (LC 1220)
  - Any problem with **action + coverage + skip**
