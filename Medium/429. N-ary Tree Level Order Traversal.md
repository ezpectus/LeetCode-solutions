# üß© Pattern Name  
**Level Order Traversal on N-ary Tree via BFS**

---

## üß† Problem Type  
**Breadth-First Traversal over Tree Structure**  
Given an N-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.  
Each level is represented as a list of integers.

## üîç Problem Anatomy

| Element      | Role                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Node`       | Tree node with value and list of children |
| `Queue<Node>`| BFS frontier for current level            |
| `res`        | Final result: list of levels              |
| `temp`       | Values collected at current level         |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Match  
This is a classic **BFS traversal** over a tree:

- Use a queue to process nodes level by level  
- For each level:
  - Track number of nodes (`n = q.Count`)  
  - Dequeue `n` nodes, collect their values  
  - Enqueue their children  
- Append collected values to result

## ‚úÖ C# Implementation

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public IList<IList<int>> LevelOrder(Node root) {
        var res = new List<IList<int>>();
        if (root == null) return res;

        var q = new Queue<Node>();
        q.Enqueue(root);

        while (q.Count != 0) {
            int n = q.Count;
            var temp = new List<int>();

            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                Node node = q.Dequeue();
                temp.Add(node.val);
                foreach (Node child in node.children)
                    q.Enqueue(child);
            }

            res.Add(temp);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value | Explanation                                 |
|------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| Time Complexity  | O(N)  | Each node visited once                      |
| Space Complexity | O(N)  | Queue and result list store all nodes       |

## üß† Architectural Commentary

- Queue-based BFS ensures level-by-level traversal  
- Children expansion is handled via `foreach` ‚Äî clean and scalable  
- Level isolation via `n = q.Count` ‚Äî avoids mixing levels  
- Null root check ensures robustness

---

## üßæ Final Takeaway

This is a standard BFS traversal adapted for **N-ary trees**, where:

- Each node may have multiple children  
- Level boundaries are tracked via queue size  
- Result is a list of lists, one per level  

The structure is reusable for any tree traversal that requires **level grouping**.
